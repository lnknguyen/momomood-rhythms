\subsection{Statistics}


After applying the data availability criteria, 5 patients and 14 controls remained. In \autoref{tab:desc_events}, we present descriptive statistics of events data collected after the filtering process displayed above.

The result in incoming call duration was skewed by a user whose average incoming call was 81 minutes.

\subsection{Viz of daily/weekly rhythms}

Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to assess normality. TST variability was normally distributed, none of the other variables were normally distributed. T-test for TST var, MWU for the rest.

- Sleep onset and Sleep offset:. All results are significant: Patients go to bed later (p=0.001) and wake up later (p<0.001).

- TST: Result was significant. Patients sleep more than Control (p=0.04)

- TST variability: result was NOT significant (p=0.13).
