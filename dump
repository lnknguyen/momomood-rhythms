For each subject, we computed the daily average of communication variables over the sampling period of 8 weeks.
 \autoref{call:desc} presents the values of calls count and duration of each group. The Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test was used to compare the mean values of all variables between the two groups. The results indicated no significant differences in mean values between the groups.

    \caption{Daily rhythm: Inter difference in call rhythm. Cell ij represents the distance in daily call rhythm between individual i and j.}
\end{figure}

\autoref{call:inter_diff} displays the matrix of inter-differences in rhythms between each pair of subjects. Using the MWU test, we compared the distances between the control and patient groups. A significant difference was observed, suggesting that the control group has more variability in their call patterns than the patient group.

\subsection{SMS}

\subsubsection*{Descriptive analysis}

Similarly, we examined the difference in outgoing and incoming messages between the two groups. \autoref{sms:desc} presents the daily average number of outgoing and incoming messages for both groups. Using the MWU test, we found no significant difference in these two variables between the groups.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Daily inter-difference}

We compare the distance in rhythms between messaging patterns. \autoref{sms:inter_diff} displays the distance metrics between the groups, showing temporal differences in messaging behaviors. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the distances between control and patient groups. No significant difference was found.

\subsection{Screen}


\subsubsection*{Descriptive analysis}

We examined the difference in screen use between the two groups. \autoref{sms:desc} presents the daily average number of outgoing and incoming messages for both groups. Using the MWU test, we found no significant difference in these two variables between the groups.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\subsubsection*{Daily inter-difference}


Patients are more varied in their phone use pattern. Two-three patients are more varied than other patients in terms of allocation of time for phone use.

\end{figure}

Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to assess normality. TST variability was normally distributed, none of the other variables were normally distributed. T-test for TST var, MWU for the rest.

- Patients wake up later (p<0.001). Sleep onset was indifferent (p=0.38) 
- TST: Patients sleep more than Control (p<0.001)
- TST variability: result was NOT significant (p=0.19).
